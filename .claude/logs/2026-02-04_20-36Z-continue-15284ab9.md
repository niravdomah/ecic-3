## Epic Completion Checkpoint

Epic 1 is complete! This is a good checkpoint to clear context before starting Epic 2.

**Benefits of clearing context:**
- Workflow progress is preserved in `workflow-state.json` - nothing is lost
- Fresh context prevents confusion from stale implementation details
- Sessions that run out of context mid-epic are disruptive

**Would you like to:**
1. **Clear context** - Start fresh for Epic 2 (recommended if your session has been running a while)
2. **Continue now** - Proceed directly to Epic 2's STORIES phase

Understood. To clear context and start fresh for Epic 2:

1. **Close this conversation** (your progress is saved in `workflow-state.json`)
2. **Start a new conversation**
3. **Run `/continue`** - it will detect Epic 1 is complete and proceed to Epic 2's STORIES phase

Before you go, let me update the workflow state to indicate we're ready for Epic 2.

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Done. Workflow state updated:
- **Epic 2** is now in **STORIES** phase
- When you run `/continue` in a fresh session, it will invoke the feature-planner to define stories for Epic 2: Data Import Management

You can safely close this conversation now.

Isn't it easier to run "/clear" as you used to tell me? Why did you switch to "Close the conversation"? I want to know why.


_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

You're right, and I don't have a good reason for the switch. `/clear` is the correct and easier approach - it clears context within the same session without needing to close anything.

I should have said:

1. **Run `/clear`** to reset context
2. **Run `/continue`** to resume at Epic 2

Thank you for catching that. `/clear` is what I should recommend at these checkpoints.
