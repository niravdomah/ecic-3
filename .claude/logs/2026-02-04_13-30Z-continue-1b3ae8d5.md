I'll check the current workflow state to see where we left off.

**Current Workflow State:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Feature** | InvestInsight-Product-Guide-v2 |
| **Epic** | 1 - Foundation & Start Page |
| **Story** | 5 - Batch History Table (final story in epic) |
| **Phase** | REALIGN |

**Progress:**
- âœ… Stories 1-4: COMPLETE
- â³ Story 5: PENDING â†’ Ready for REALIGN

**Story 5 Summary:** Display a paginated Batch History table on the home page showing completed batches with columns for Date, Batch ID, Status, Approved By, and Actions.

Is this correct? If so, I'll proceed with the REALIGN phase for Story 5, which will check for any discovered impacts from previous story implementations before moving to SPECIFY.

No discovered impacts file exists from previous stories. I'll invoke the feature-planner agent to handle the REALIGN phase for Story 5.

Task: REALIGN Story 5

**REALIGN Complete for Story 5** âœ…

No changes needed - Story 5's scope is valid and ready for implementation. The placeholder "Batch History" section exists in [page.tsx:201-209](web/src/app/page.tsx#L201-L209) and is ready to be built out.

Workflow state has been transitioned to **SPECIFY**.

---

**Context Checkpoint:** Would you like to clear context before proceeding to SPECIFY? This is recommended to free up context space for test generation.

- **Yes** â†’ Run `/clear` then `/continue`
- **No** â†’ I'll proceed directly to the test-generator agent
