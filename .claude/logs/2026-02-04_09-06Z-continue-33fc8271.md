Perfect. Now I have a complete understanding of the feature. Let me analyze the specification and wireframes to define the epics.

**Current State:**
- **Feature:** InvestInsight-Product-Guide-v2
- **Phase:** SCOPE (defining epics)
- **Epic:** 1
- **Story:** Not yet at story level

**Progress:**
- âœ… DESIGN phase completed (15 wireframes created)
- â³ SCOPE phase in progress (need to define all epics)

The workflow was interrupted during the SCOPE phase. We need to define all epics for this feature before moving to story creation.

Does this match your understanding of where we left off? If correct, I'll invoke the `feature-planner` agent to continue defining the epics.

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

| **2** | Data Import Management | Portfolio Imports & Other Imports dashboards |

| **4** | Core Data Maintenance | 5 maintenance screens: Instruments, Index Prices, Durations & YTM, Betas, Credit Ratings |
| **5** | Workflow & Approvals | Multi-level approval system (L1, L2, L3) |
| **6** | Comments, Logs & Admin | Report Comments, Process/Calculation Logs, Administration screens |
| **7** | Reference Data Management | CRUD for all reference entities (Countries, Currencies, Portfolios, etc.) |

Please run:

1. `/clear` - to clear the conversation context

This will give the test-generator agent fresh context for writing the failing tests.
