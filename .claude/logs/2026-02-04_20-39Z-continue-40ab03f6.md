I'll check the current workflow state to see where we left off.

## Current State

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Feature** | InvestInsight-Product-Guide-v2 |
| **Epic 1** | Foundation & Start Page - âœ… COMPLETE (5/5 stories) |
| **Epic 2** | Data Import Management - ðŸ“‹ STORIES phase |
| **Phase** | STORIES (need to define stories for Epic 2) |

## Epic Completion Checkpoint

Epic 1 is complete! This is a good checkpoint to clear context if you'd like a fresh start for Epic 2.

**Benefits of clearing context:**
- Workflow progress is preserved in `workflow-state.json` - nothing is lost
- Clears implementation details from Epic 1 that could cause confusion
- Gives you maximum context capacity for Epic 2's implementation

**Epic 2: Data Import Management** will cover:
- Portfolio Imports dashboard (grid matrix with batch/file type structure)
- Other Imports dashboard (simple list of shared reference files)
- File upload, status tracking, and error handling

**Would you like to:**
1. **Clear context** - Start fresh for Epic 2 (recommended if session feels heavy)
2. **Continue in this session** - Proceed directly to STORIES phase for Epic 2

Please confirm, and I'll proceed accordingly.

Good choice. Clearing context at epic boundaries helps ensure you have full capacity for the next epic's implementation.

## How to Continue

1. **Close this conversation** (your logs will be saved)
2. **Start a new conversation** in Claude Code
3. **Run `/continue`** - the workflow state will show Epic 2 at STORIES phase

The `workflow-state.json` file you have open shows all progress is preserved:
- Epic 1 marked COMPLETE with all 5 stories
- Epic 2 ready at STORIES phase

When you run `/continue` in the new session, I'll invoke the `feature-planner` agent to define the stories for Epic 2 (Data Import Management).
