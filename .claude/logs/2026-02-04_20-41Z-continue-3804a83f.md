## Current Workflow State

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Feature** | InvestInsight-Product-Guide-v2 |
| **Epic** | 2 - Data Import Management |
| **Phase** | STORIES |
| **Epic 1 Status** | âœ… COMPLETE (5/5 stories) |

**Epic 2 Description:** Implement Portfolio Imports and Other Imports dashboards with file upload, status tracking, and error handling.

---

This is the correct continuation point - Epic 1 completed and we're ready to define stories for Epic 2. Please confirm this is correct and I'll invoke the `feature-planner` agent to define the stories for Epic 2.

**When you confirm, the feature-planner agent will:**
1. Analyze Screen 2 (Portfolio Imports), Screen 3 (Other Imports), and Screen 4 (File Upload Modal) specifications
2. Create user stories with acceptance criteria for Epic 2
3. Transition to REALIGN for Story 1

Ready to proceed?
