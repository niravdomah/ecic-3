I'll start the TDD workflow. First, let me check for feature specifications in the documentation/ directory.

Let me check if there's any existing workflow state and if wireframes already exist.

I found a comprehensive feature specification for **InvestInsight** - a portfolio reporting and data stewardship platform with:

**12 Screens:**
1. Start Page
2. File Uploads (Portfolio Imports & Other Imports)
3. Data Confirmation
4. Instruments Maintenance
5. Index Prices Maintenance
6. Durations & YTM Maintenance
7. Instrument Betas Maintenance
8. Credit Ratings Maintenance
9. Report Comments
10. Approvals (L1, L2, L3)
11. Process Logs
12. Administration

**Key Features:**
- Multi-level approval workflow (L1 â†’ L2 â†’ L3)
- Full audit trails for all data changes
- Multiple data maintenance screens with CRUD operations
- File upload and validation capabilities
- Reference data management

**API Specs Available:**
- [DataMaintenanceAPIDefinition.yaml](documentation/DataMaintenanceAPIDefinition.yaml)
- [FileImporterAPIDefinition.yaml](documentation/FileImporterAPIDefinition.yaml)
- [MonthlyAPIDefinition.yaml](documentation/MonthlyAPIDefinition.yaml)

This feature involves extensive UI screens. Would you like me to:

1. **Create wireframes first** using the **ui-ux-designer** agent (Recommended for complex UI)
2. **Proceed directly to scoping** with the **feature-planner** agent

Given the 12 screens with complex data grids, modals, and workflow states, wireframes would help visualize the UI structure before defining epics and stories. What would you prefer?

**Result:**
Now I'll analyze the specification and propose a screen list for your approval.

## Proposed Screens

Based on the InvestInsight Product Guide, I propose creating wireframes for the following **12 screens**:

1. **Start Page** - Dashboard showing current batch status, create new batch button, batch ...

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

I'll initialize the workflow state for the DESIGN phase and then launch the ui-ux-designer agent to create wireframes.

Task: Create wireframes for InvestInsight

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

The **ui-ux-designer** agent has analyzed the specification and proposes **14 screens** for wireframes:

| # | Screen | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Start Page | Dashboard with batch status, create button, history, navigation |
| 2 | Portfolio Imports Dashboard | Matrix grid (portfolios Ã— file types) with status icons |
| 3 | Other Imports Dashboard | Simple list of non-portfolio files with status |
| 4 | File Upload Modal | Shared popup for upload, status, errors (used by #2 & #3) |
| 5 | Data Confirmation | Tabbed interface: Main File Checks, Other Checks, Re-imports |
| 6 | Instruments Maintenance | CRUD grid with audit trail access |
| 7 | Index Prices Maintenance | Price grid with history view |
| 8 | Durations & YTM Maintenance | Duration/YTM grid with outstanding view |
| 9 | Instrument Betas Maintenance | Beta values grid with outstanding view |
| 10 | Credit Ratings Maintenance | Ratings grid with changes view |
| 11 | Report Comments | Commentary grid for reports |
| 12 | Approvals Dashboard | L1/L2/L3 approval interface with review/actions |
| 13 | Process Logs | Tabbed: File Logs, Monthly Logs, Calc Logs, Errors |
| 14 | Administration | User/role management, page access control |

**Changes from original spec:**
- Added Screen 4 (File Upload Modal) as a shared critical component
- Separated Process Logs (Screen 13) as distinct functionality
- Administration (Screen 14) as key functional area

**Do you approve this screen list?** (Yes/No, or provide modifications)
