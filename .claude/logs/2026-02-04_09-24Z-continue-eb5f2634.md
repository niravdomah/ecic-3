**Summary - Ready to Resume**

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Epic** | 1 - Foundation & Start Page |
| **Story** | 1 - Home Page Setup |
| **Phase** | IMPLEMENT |
| **Test File** | [epic-1-story-1-home-page-setup.test.tsx](web/src/__tests__/integration/epic-1-story-1-home-page-setup.test.tsx) |
| **Target File** | [app/page.tsx](web/src/app/page.tsx) |
| **Tests** | 15 failing, 2 passing |

**Failing Tests Need:**
1. Change heading from "Welcome" to "InvestInsight"
2. Add top navigation with Dashboard, Data Confirmation, Maintenance menu, User profile
3. Remove template placeholder text
4. Add three main sections as `<section aria-label="...">`: Current Batch Status, Quick Navigation, Batch History
5. Ensure responsive layout and proper accessibility (heading hierarchy, landmarks)

Does this look correct? If so, I'll hand off to the developer agent to implement the changes.

## Next Up: Epic 1, Story 2 - Create New Batch

Before proceeding, would you like to clear context? This is recommended between stories to keep the conversation focused.

- **Yes** â†’ Run `/clear` then `/continue` to start fresh
- **No** â†’ I'll proceed directly to Story 2 (REALIGN phase)

_**User: Nirav Domah (2026-02-04 09:37Z)**_

Yes


_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

To clear context and continue with Story 2:

1. Run `/clear` to reset the conversation
2. Run `/continue` to resume the TDD workflow

This will start fresh with Epic 1, Story 2: Create New Batch in the REALIGN phase.
