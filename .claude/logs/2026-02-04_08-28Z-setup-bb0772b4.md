I'll help you set up this project. Let me check the current state and get everything ready.

Great! CLAUDE.md already exists. Let me install dependencies and verify the setup.

Bash: Install npm dependencies

---

_**Agent (model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)**_

Dependencies installed! Now let me verify the setup with the key checks.

Perfect! Project setup is complete. Here's the status:

```
Project Setup Complete! âœ“

[âœ“] CLAUDE.md exists with project documentation
[âœ“] Dependencies installed (1198 packages)
[âœ“] TypeScript compiles successfully
[âœ“] ESLint configured (no errors)
[âœ“] Production build successful

Next Steps:
  npm run dev    â†’ Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
  /start         â†’ Begin building a feature with TDD workflow
  /status        â†’ Check your current workflow progress
```

## What would you like to do?

- **Start the dev server:** Run `npm run dev` in the /web directory
- **Build a feature:** Use `/start` to kick off the TDD workflow from a feature spec
- **Learn the project:** I can explain the architecture, testing patterns, or API client setup

What's your next move?

Can you use 3000 instead. Kill the stuff that's running on 3000 if you have to.

Continue


_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

What would you like to continue with? Options:

1. **Start building a feature** - Use `/start` to kick off the TDD workflow from a feature spec in `documentation/`
2. **Resume a workflow** - Use `/continue` if you have an interrupted TDD session
3. **Something else** - Let me know what you'd like to work on

Which would you like?

_**User: Nirav Domah (2026-02-04 08:36Z)**_

Should you be asking me to clear the context? No need to do it now. I just want to know if you should have done it.


_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

No, I don't think I should have. Here's my reasoning:

1. **No instruction to do so** - Nothing in CLAUDE.md or my guidelines tells me to suggest clearing context after completing tasks

2. **Automatic summarization** - The system notes that "the conversation has unlimited context through automatic summarization," so context management is handled automatically

3. **User preference** - Clearing context is a workflow decision that should be up to you, not something I proactively suggest

That said, I can see an argument for suggesting it after completing a discrete task like setup - the port-killing back-and-forth isn't useful context for your next task. If you'd like me to suggest context clearing after completing major milestones, I can do that going forward.
