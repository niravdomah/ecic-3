I can see the current state. **Story 4 - Quick Navigation Cards** is in the IMPLEMENT phase with 17 failing tests. The tests show that currently only the Data Confirmation card exists, but 5 more cards are needed: File Uploads, Instruments, Index Prices, Approvals, and Process Logs.

**Does this look correct to you?** If so, I'll hand off to the developer agent to implement the remaining navigation cards.

**Failing Tests (17):** The test file `epic-1-story-4-quick-navigation-cards.test.tsx` expects six navigation cards. Currently only Data Confirmation exists. Missing:

I see. The tests are using `toHaveClass(/hover:/)` which checks for CSS classes - this is an anti-pattern according to the test quality validator. However, these tests were generated by the test-generator agent in the SPECIFY phase, not by me.

According to the developer agent instructions: "Test qu...
